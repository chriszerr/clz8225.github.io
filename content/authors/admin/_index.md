I am currently a PhD candidate in Dr. Kathleen McDermott's Memory & Cognition Lab at Washington University in St. Louis. I received my B.Sc. in Psychology and Statistical Methods from Truman State University in 2015, and my A.M. in Psychological & Brain Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. I also spent time in cardiovascular and neuroscience research labs at the University of Michigan and the University of Vermont, respectively.

My main interests are in examining individual differences in long-term memory, with a current focus on the relation between how quickly people learn information and how well they remember it over time. I participate in the Cognitive, Computational, and Systems Neuroscience (CCSN) pathway and was a National Science Foundation GRFP recipient.
